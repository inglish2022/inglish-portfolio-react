        I am working towards the end of my journey as a developer. I have worked with front-end and back-end developing. I do not have many projects under my belt but I will work very hard at any project I start.
      </p>
      <p>
         By the end of my coding bootcamp I will have the practical, technical skills that will enable me to build great web applications. I will be proficient in many technoligies, including JavaScript, Node, SQL, MongoDB, and React.
      </p>
      Cheers!
